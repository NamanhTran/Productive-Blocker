# Productive Blocker

A simple webblocker that blocks sites that may not contribute to productivity.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need:

- Ubuntu (CURRENTLY ONLY SUPPORTED)
- Python 3.7 or later
- Tkinter (python module)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get the program running

If you do not have Python 3.7 or later installed run this command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```

If you do not have Tkinter module installed run this command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

After installing these dependencies run this command in the terminal inside the folder you downloaded the project in:

```bash
sudo python3 webblocker.py
```

Afterwards a window should popup. This is the program's GUI.
